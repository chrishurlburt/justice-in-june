          Over the course of the month, you will have spent 5 hours intentionally learning how to be an active ally of the black community. (That’s less than the amount of time it takes to watch all of Tiger King ~ 5.5 hours.) Remember, the black community lives the reality of the information you will learn- they have a lifetime of fearing for their well being versus 5 hours of you being uncomfortable. All the action items listed in the calendar have linked information below the weekly schedule (see sections Watch, Read, Listen, and Act).

Write to your city or town government representative and police chief and advocate for it. Multiply your voice by soliciting others to advocate as well, writing on social media about it, writing op-eds, etc.

          Over the course of the month, you will have spent 12.5 hours intentionally learning how to be an active ally of the black community. (That’s less than the amount of time it takes to watch Season 24 of the Bachelor in 2020 ~ 18 hours.) Remember, the black community lives the reality of the information you will learn- they have a lifetime of fearing for their well being versus you being uncomfortable for half a day. All the action items listed in the calendar have linked information below the weekly schedule (see sections Watch, Read, Listen, and Act).

            If you or a friend is an educator, buy said friend books that feature POC as protagonists and heroes, no matter the racial make-up of the class.

Use these items year-round, not just in February. The racial make-up of students doesn’t matter — kids of every race need to know American history and be exposed to people from different races, religions, and countries. If the friend is interested, buy them for your pal’s classroom. Don’t be shy to ask Facebook friends that you haven’t actually talked to in ten years.

        <p>
          Over the course of the month, you will have spent 22.5 hours intentionally learning how to be an active ally of the black community. (That’s less than the amount of time it takes to watch all of Avatar: The Last Airbender ~ 30 hours.) Remember, the black community lives the reality of the information you will learn- they have a lifetime of fearing for their well being versus you being uncomfortable for less than a day. All the action items listed in the calendar have linked information below the weekly schedule (see sections Watch, Read, Listen, and Act).

            Google whether your city or town currently employs evidence-based police de-escalation training. The racial make-up of your town doesn’t matter — This needs to be standard everywhere. Write to your city or town government representative and police chief and advocate for it. Multiply your voice by soliciting others to advocate as well, writing on social media about it, writing op-eds, etc.
